<!--
    A higher order functons is a function that either returns or receives a functioon as an argument is called a high order function
    Any function that is passed as an argument is called a callback function.A callback function is usually an anonymous function.Anonymous functions cannot be defined separately as we cannot call them because they have no name. So they are usually passed as arguments

        //but callback functions donâ€™t always have to be defined in our function call.
        //They can be defined elsewhere in our code. See below example which will have the same result.

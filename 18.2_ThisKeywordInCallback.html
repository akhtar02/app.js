            var clientData = {
                fullName: "Not Set",
                // setUserName is a method on the clientData object
                setUserName: function (firstName, lastName) { //setUserName is local to clientData
                    // this refers to the fullName property in this object
                    this.fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
                }
            }

            function getUserInput(firstName, lastName, callback) {//getUserInput is a global function
                // Do other stuff to validate firstName/lastName here
                let fullName="Global Func"
                // Now save the names
                callback(firstName, lastName);// becuase object method is called from another function the THIS in the definition will refer to global
                alert(fullName) //1st display - GlobalFunc - as it refers to local
                alert(this.fullName);//2nd display - Barrack Obama - this.fullname will refer to global whereas fullName 
            }
/*************************************************************************************/    
//if clientData.UserName() is called directly then THIS is binded to object Clientdata. 
//As a result Clientdata.fullName is reset-uncomment below code to check********/
                // clientData.setUserName("atif","saeed"); 
                // alert(clientData.fullName);
                //alert(fullName)//see how the output changes after removing this from line 16

/*************************************************************************************/    

//if getUserInput() calls clientData.setUserName() then clientData.fullName is NOT reset
//As getUserInput() is a global function and therefore THIS is binded to global variable 
//this.fullName eventhough written inside clientData.setUserName() represents the global fullName ********/

                getUserInput("Barack", "Obama", clientData.setUserName);

                alert(clientData.fullName);//3rd Display - Not Set

                // The fullName property was initialized on the window object
                alert(window.fullName); // 4th Display - Barack obama - refers to Global Variable

//CONCLUSION
// Can we say:
// in case of method call from objects THIS is binded to object scope
// in case of global function call, THIS is binded to global scope
// behaviour of this and without this is completely different b/w an object method and a regular function

// or
// It may also help to simply state the rules: 
// 1. this refers to the global (window) object unless 
// 2. the function is invoked as a method(a regular function inside an object) or unless 
// 3. The function is invoked with new or unless 
// 4. “Use strict” is in play causing it to be undefined, or unless 
// 5. it’s set with call or apply or unless 
// 6. ES6 stuff.


//THERE IS A SOLUTION FOR THIS BEHAVIOUR USING CALLBACK AND APPLY, LOOK AT THE LINK

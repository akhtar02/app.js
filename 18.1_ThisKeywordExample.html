3 things to watch in the below example
1-  -Why does ‘this’ bind to the window object? Because ‘this’, always references the owner of the function it is in, 
    for this case — since it is now out of scope — the window/global object.
    When it is inside of an object’s method — the function’s owner is the object. 
    Thus the ‘this’ keyword is bound to the object. 
    Yet when it is inside of a function, either stand alone or within another method,
    it will always refer to the window/global object.(see Callback Example and Function Example)
    (Also see 4th link to understand point1)
2-  Usage of var vs let will define global or local scope.As a side note, variables declared with let or const 
    at the global level are not stored in the global object, but instead in an inaccessible declarative environment 
    record(see link 1)
3-  The scope of this is different in an arrow function vs a function defined by function keyword in an object.
    This is why arrow functions are useless in obect methods

or
It may also help to simply state the rules: 
1. this refers to the global (window) object unless 
2. the function is invoked as a method(a regular function inside an object) or unless 
3. The function is invoked with new or unless 
4. “Use strict” is in play causing it to be undefined, or unless 
5. it’s set with call or apply or unless 
6. ES6 stuff.
